# Stathis Mobile App - UI Analysis & Patterns (Current)

## Current Snapshot (authoritative)

- Navigation
  - 3 tabs: Learn (`learn`), Practice (`practice` - start destination), Profile (`profile`)
  - Implemented in `features/home/AppShell.kt`, `HomeBottomNavigation.kt`, `HomeNavHost.kt`, `HomeNavigationItem.kt`
  - Secondary routes: `settings`, `help`, `terms`, `privacy`, `exercise_test`
- Theme
  - Use `core/theme/AppThemeWithProvider.kt` to provide `MaterialTheme`
  - Colors from `core/theme/Color.kt` via `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`
  - Typography from `core/theme/Type.kt` via `MaterialTheme.typography`
  - ViewModel: `core/theme/ThemeViewModel.kt` controls theme mode
- Insets & Layout
  - Use `Scaffold` content `innerPadding` when bottom bar is visible
  - Otherwise apply `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.statusBars)` for top bars
  - Always respect bottom safe area: `WindowInsets.navigationBars.only(sides = WindowInsetsSides.Bottom)`
  - Default screen horizontal padding: 24.dp
- CTA Buttons
  - Primary: full width, 56.dp height, `containerColor = colorScheme.primary`, `contentColor = onPrimary`, text `typography.labelLarge`
  - Secondary: text button style using `onSurface`
- Onboarding patterns
  - Two-column height layout: hero area (mascot/title/body) + bottom actions (dots/CTA/link)
  - Pager dots: active = `primary`, inactive = `onSurfaceVariant` at 50% alpha
- Mascot
  - See `HOW-TO-ADD-MASCOT.md` for PNG/WebP, vector XML, and Lottie JSON guidance

## Detailed Module Analysis

### Home Module
- **Current**: Bottom navigation with 5 tabs (Dashboard, Exercise, Tasks, Vitals, Profile)
- **Issues**: Too many navigation options, complex structure, overwhelming for students
- **Target**: Simplified main screen with clear CTAs, mascot as guide

### Dashboard Module
- **Current**: Complex dashboard with multiple cards (UserProfileSummary, HealthMetricsCard, TasksSummaryCard, ClassroomCard)
- **Issues**: Information overload, too many metrics at once
- **Target**: Duolingo-style progress overview with mascot, single focus per screen

### Exercise Module
- **Current**: Complex multi-state UI (Initial, PermissionNeeded, ExerciseSelection, ExerciseIntroduction, ExerciseActive, ExerciseSummary, Error)
- **Issues**: Too many states, complex camera integration, overwhelming interface
- **Target**: Simple exercise interface with mascot guidance, gamified completion

### Tasks Module
- **Current**: Tab-based task management (All, Today, Upcoming, Completed) with classroom selection
- **Issues**: Too many tabs, complex filtering, overwhelming task lists
- **Target**: Gamified task completion with mascot rewards, single task focus

### Progress Module
- **Current**: Tab-based progress (Achievements, Badges, Leaderboard) with complex metrics
- **Issues**: Data-heavy interface, too many progress indicators
- **Target**: Visual progress with mascot celebrations, simplified achievements

### Vitals Module
- **Current**: Complex health tracking with Health Connect integration, real-time and history tabs
- **Issues**: Technical complexity, overwhelming health data
- **Target**: Simple health tracking with mascot motivation, gamified wellness

### Profile Module
- **Current**: Standard profile management with edit functionality
- **Issues**: Standard form-based interface
- **Target**: Minimal profile with mascot customization, personality-driven

## Current UI Pain Points Identified

1. **Navigation Overload**: 5 bottom navigation tabs create decision paralysis
2. **Information Density**: Too many metrics and data points on single screens
3. **Complex State Management**: Multiple UI states per module increase cognitive load
4. **Lack of Gamification**: No progress celebrations or motivational elements
5. **Technical Complexity**: Complex integrations (camera, health data) without simplification
6. **No Personality**: Missing mascot character to guide and motivate students
7. **Inconsistent Design**: Different patterns across modules
8. **Overwhelming CTAs**: Too many action buttons and options per screen

## Design Principles (Duolingo-inspired)
1. **Simplicity**: Big text, minimal CTAs
2. **Gamification**: Progress bars, achievements, mascot interactions
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: One main action per screen
4. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate rewards and celebrations
5. **Mascot Integration**: Guide, motivate, and celebrate with user

## Proposed New Navigation Structure

### Current (5 tabs):
- Dashboard, Exercise, Tasks, Vitals, Profile

### Proposed (3 tabs):
- **Learn** (Main learning hub with mascot)
- **Progress** (Achievements, streaks, mascot celebrations)
- **Profile** (Minimal profile with mascot customization)

### New Screen Hierarchy:

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
---

## Onboarding Polished Patterns (what to imitate)

1) Layout
- Horizontal padding: 24dp
- Bottom safe area: `WindowInsets.navigationBars.only(Bottom)`
- Structure per page (two-column height):
  - Top content `Column(weight = 1f)`: Mascot (top) → Title → Body
  - Bottom actions: Dots → CTA → Secondary link (anchored at bottom)

2) Mascot
- Full width, height ~320dp, `ContentScale.Fit`
- Single focal illustration; avoid busy backgrounds

3) Typography
- Title uses `headlineLarge` (Inter Bold)
- Body uses `bodyLarge` (Outfit Regular)
- Buttons/links use `labelLarge`

4) Colors
- Background from `colorScheme.surface` (dark), text from `onSurface`/`onSurfaceVariant`
- CTA button uses `colorScheme.primary`/`onPrimary`; dot indicator active `primary`, inactive `onSurfaceVariant` 50% alpha
- Dynamic color disabled; rely on brand palette from `Color.kt`

5) Components & Tokens
- Primary button height: 56dp; full width
- Dots indicator size: 8dp (active +2dp)
- Spacing: 12dp between title/body; 16dp around actions

6) Interaction
- HorizontalPager with 3 steps
- Button advances page; last page continues flow

These rules should be reused for future screens (marketing slides, simple intros, success screens) to maintain visual consistency.

### Theme Selection Screen Analysis

- Problem solved: Immediate visual feedback when choosing theme by staying on the screen and applying theme live.
- Interaction: Tapping a card calls `themeViewModel.setThemeMode(LIGHT|DARK)`; screen shows updated colors instantly; "Confirm" advances.
- Layout tokens:
  - Root: `Modifier.fillMaxSize().background(colorScheme.surface).padding(horizontal = 24.dp)` with bottom `navigationBars` insets
  - Title: `headlineLarge` (Inter Bold), `onSurface` color
  - Options: `surfaceVariant` background, emoji + label row, `onSurface` text
  - Helper text: `bodyMedium`, `onSurfaceVariant`
  - Confirm button: full width, 56dp height, `primary/onPrimary`
- Visual consistency: Same paddings, spacers, and button shape as onboarding pages.
1. Add actual mascot images/animations (Lottie)
2. Implement real data integration
3. Add celebration animations
4. Create mascot customization options
5. Add voice integration for mascot
